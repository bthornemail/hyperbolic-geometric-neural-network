## 🌱 **Create Your First Regenerative Project**

### **Step 1: New Project Wizard**

Click **"+ New Project"** and select:

```typescript
Project Type: "Carbon Credit Marketplace"
Template: "Beginner Friendly"
Blockchain: "Polygon" (low carbon footprint)
AI Assistant: "Enabled"
```

### **Step 2: Project Configuration**

```yaml
# project-config.yaml (auto-generated)
name: "my-carbon-marketplace"
type: "regenerative_marketplace"
target_impact:
  carbon_sequestration: 100  # tons CO2e per year
  farmers_supported: 10      # number of farmers
  economic_value: 50000      # USD generated

stakeholders:
  - type: "farmer"
    count: 10
  - type: "corporate_buyer"
    count: 5
  - type: "verifier"
    count: 2

blockchain:
  network: "polygon"
  gas_optimization: "enabled"
  regenerative_scoring: "enabled"
```

### **Step 3: AI-Generated Smart Contracts**

The AI will automatically generate smart contracts for you:

```solidity
// Auto-generated CarbonCreditToken.sol
contract CarbonCreditToken is ERC20 {
    mapping(address => uint256) public carbonSequestered;
    
    function mintForImpact(
        address farmer,
        uint256 carbonAmount,
        bytes calldata verification
    ) external {
        // Verify impact measurement
        require(verifyImpact(verification), "Invalid verification");
        
        // Mint tokens based on impact
        uint256 tokens = carbonAmount * 10; // 10 tokens per ton CO2e
        _mint(farmer, tokens);
        
        carbonSequestered[farmer] += carbonAmount;
        emit ImpactVerified(farmer, carbonAmount, tokens);
    }
}
```

**What just happened?**
- AI analyzed your requirements
- Generated optimized smart contracts
- Integrated regenerative impact measurement
- Set up token economics aligned with environmental goals

## 🤖 **Using AI Agents**

### **Available AI Agents**

HyperDev IDE includes several specialized AI agents:

| Agent | Purpose | How to Use |
|-------|---------|------------|
| **🏗️ Architect Agent** | Smart contract design | `@architect design a carbon marketplace` |
| **🔍 Security Agent** | Code auditing | `@security audit my contracts` |
| **🌱 Impact Agent** | Regenerative optimization | `@impact optimize for carbon sequestration` |
| **📊 Analytics Agent** | Performance analysis | `@analytics show gas usage` |
| **🎨 UI Agent** | Frontend generation | `@ui create farmer dashboard` |

### **Example: Using the Impact Agent**

```typescript
// Type in the chat panel:
@impact "How can I optimize my carbon credit contract for maximum environmental benefit?"

// AI Response:
🌱 Impact Agent: I've analyzed your contract and found 3 optimization opportunities:

1. **Batch Minting** - Reduce gas costs by 60% with batch operations
2. **Biodiversity Bonus** - Add 25% bonus tokens for biodiversity improvements  
3. **Soil Health Integration** - Connect to IoT soil sensors for real-time verification

Would you like me to implement these optimizations?
```

Type `yes` and the AI will automatically update your code!

---

## 🔗 **Web3 Integration**

### **Connect to Real Impact Data**

```typescript
// In your project, add impact measurement:
import { ImpactMeasurement } from '@hyperdev/regenerative';

const impact = new ImpactMeasurement({
  sensors: ['soil_carbon_probe', 'satellite_monitoring'],
  verification: ['third_party_auditor', 'peer_validation'],
  frequency: 'weekly'
});

// Real-time impact tracking
impact.onMeasurement(async (data) => {
  console.log('🌱 New impact measurement:', data);
  
  // Automatically mint tokens for verified impact
  if (data.confidence > 0.9) {
    await carbonContract.mintForImpact(
      data.farmer,
      data.carbonSequestered,
      data.verification
    );
  }
});
```

### **P2P Collaboration**

```typescript
// Start a collaboration session
const session = await hyperdev.startP2PSession({
  type: 'code_review',
  participants: ['farmer.eth', 'verifier.dao'],
  economic_agreements: {
    review_payment: '25 USDC',
    impact_sharing: '5%'
  }
});

// Real-time code collaboration with economic incentives
session.on('participant_joined', (participant) => {
  console.log(`🤝 ${participant.username} joined`);
  console.log(`💰 Will earn ${session.agreements.review_payment} for participation`);
});
```

---

## 📊 **Monitoring Impact**

### **Real-time Impact Dashboard**

Your HyperDev IDE includes a built-in impact dashboard:

```typescript
// View your regenerative impact
const impact = await hyperdev.getImpactMetrics();

console.log('🌍 Your Regenerative Impact:');
console.log(`Carbon Sequestered: ${impact.carbon.sequestered} tons CO2e`);
console.log(`Farmers Supported: ${impact.social.farmersSupported}`);
console.log(`Economic Value Created: $${impact.economic.totalValue}`);
console.log(`Biodiversity Improvement: +${impact.biodiversity.improvement}%`);

// Your code is making a real difference! 🌱
```

### **Weekly Impact Reports**

Every week, you'll receive an automated report:

```
