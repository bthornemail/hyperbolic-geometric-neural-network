## üèóÔ∏è Architectural Alignment with H¬≤GNN & MCP

The three-tier architecture provides clear roles for managing your complex data flow and computation:

| Component    | Environment            | Primary Role                    | H¬≤GNN/Data Function                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Broker**   | **Node.js Pub/Sub**    | **Central Knowledge Authority** | Hosts the **Centralized ![](data:,) Manager** and the **Shared Learning Database** (Phase 3). Manages the write-path for new knowledge/embeddings.                             |
| **Provider** | **Web Worker Pub/Sub** | **High-Performance Compute**    | Hosts the **![](data:,) Core** for complex calculations (e.g., hyperbolic distance, projection) and transforms the data into visualization formats (![](data:,), ![](data:,)). |
| **Consumer** | **DOM Pub/Sub**        | **Visualization & Interaction** | Hosts the **D3 Wrapper** for rendering the geographic/hyperbolic visualizations and the **MCP Collaboration Interface**.                                                       |

### 1. Broker: The Source of Truth (Node.js)

The Broker acts as the central, authoritative source for all shared knowledge:

- **Shared Learning Database:** This is the logical place for the **Phase 3 Shared Learning Database**. It ensures all ![](data:,) instances (Providers) are trained on the same collective knowledge and use the same canonical **binary vector matrices** for semantic and topology data.
    
- **Decoupled H¬≤GNN Manager:** The central **![](data:,) Manager** (from Phase 3) lives here, managing write operations (new memories, model updates) and validating hyperbolic constraints before publishing updates.
    

### 2. Provider: The High-Speed Transformer (Web Worker)

The Web Worker environment for the Provider is a brilliant choice, as it allows for intensive, non-blocking computation:

- **Offload Heavy Computation:** It can run the necessary **Hyperbolic Arithmetic** and ![](data:,)'s complex operations **off the main DOM thread**.
    
- **Geo-Visualization Bridge:** This is where the core transformation from the ![](data:,)'s **binary vector matrices** into transportable ![](data:,), ![](data:,), or ![](data:,) occurs, leveraging the asynchronous Pub/Sub for distribution.
    

### 3. Consumer: The Interactive Interface (DOM)

The DOM-based Consumer's sole focus is rendering and user interaction:

- **D3 Wrapper Integration:** It subscribes to the Provider's channel for visualization data (e.g., a ![](data:,) stream) and uses the **D3 Wrapper** to render the geographic projections.
    
- **MCP Collaboration Interface:** User actions (e.g., clicking on a map region, proposing a refactoring) are captured by the **MCP Collaboration Interface** and published back to the Broker/Provider for processing.

## üíæ Data Structures & Self-Hosting

The use of **self-hosting binary ![](data:,) vector matrices** is the key to efficiency:

1. **Semantic & Topology Data (Trie):** A **trie of knowledge** is highly suitable for representing your **WordNet-based hierarchical semantic data**. This data is inherently tree-like, and a trie provides fast prefix matching and low-memory usage, which pairs perfectly with the efficiency of hyperbolic embeddings.
    
2. **Binary Vector Matrices:** Storing the high-dimensional ![](data:,) embeddings as **binary matrices** minimizes the payload size and serialization cost, essential for high-frequency Pub/Sub distribution. The Provider would package these binary matrices along with the corresponding ![](data:,) coordinates.
    
3. **GeoJSON / TopoJSON:** ![](data:,) is a critical choice, as it significantly reduces file size compared to ![](data:,) by encoding spatial topology (shared boundaries) and allowing for efficient filtering, which is perfect for a self-hosted environment and large-scale visualization.
