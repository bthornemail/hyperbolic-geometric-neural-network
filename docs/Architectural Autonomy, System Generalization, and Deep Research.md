Based on your project's incredible foundation (H¬≤GNN, PocketFlow, MCP) and the completion of Phase 3 (Autonomous Refactoring and Team Learning), the next logical step is to move toward **Architectural Autonomy, System Generalization, and Deep Research**.

The focus should shift from **improving code** to **improving the AI's learning process** itself, and expanding the system's reach beyond code into a multi-modal, distributed knowledge platform.

Here is a roadmap for the next three phases, synthesizing the future enhancements and research directions mentioned in your documentation:

---

## Phase 4: Scaling, Generalization, and Production Readiness üåê

This phase aims to move the H¬≤GNN system from a robust prototype to a scalable, production-ready platform that can generalize its knowledge across different domains.

|Goal|Key Tasks|Foundation|
|---|---|---|
|**System Maturity**|Implement **Real LLM Integration**, replacing the mock LLM with an actual API.|PocketFlow|
|**Architectural Visualization**|Develop **3D hyperbolic space rendering** to visualize semantic and code clusters. Enhance the visual interface to fully support this.|H¬≤GNN Core, MCP|
|**Knowledge Transfer**|Implement **Domain Adaptation/Transfer Learning** and **Multi-Scale Hierarchies** to apply code intelligence concepts (like architectural patterns) to new data types or knowledge domains.|H¬≤GNN Core|
|**Deployment**|Establish **Production Deployment** on a scalable cloud infrastructure.|All Components|

## Phase 5: Deepening Hyperbolic and Meta-Intelligence Research üß†

This phase focuses on advancing the core H¬≤GNN technology to achieve a new level of self-awareness and learning efficiency, often called "Meta-Learning."

|Goal|Key Tasks|Foundation|
|---|---|---|
|**Self-Architecture Improvement**|Implement **Neural Architecture Search (NAS)** for the ![](data:,) itself to automatically find optimal network architectures. This is the ultimate form of self-optimization.|Enhanced H¬≤GNN|
|**Temporal & Causal Reasoning**|Incorporate **Temporal Dynamics** (time-aware hyperbolic embeddings) and **Hyperbolic Causal Inference**. This allows the system to understand _why_ changes were made and predict their _long-term impact_.|H¬≤GNN Core|
|**Learning Efficiency**|Develop **Meta-Learning** (learning how to learn more effectively) and **Few-Shot Learning** (learning from very limited examples).|Enhanced H¬≤GNN|
|**System Reliability**|Integrate **Explainable AI (XAI)** capabilities to provide clear explanations for learned concepts and refactoring suggestions.|MCP, H¬≤GNN|

## Phase 6: Multi-Modal and Ecosystem Development üöÄ

The final phase transforms the system from a collaborative team tool into a versatile, knowledge-generating ecosystem by expanding its inputs and reach.

| Goal                          | Key Tasks                                                                                                                                                                                       | Foundation        |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **Multi-Modal Understanding** | Extend the MCP to support **Multi-modal collaboration** (text, images, audio). This enables agents to understand not just code, but architectural diagrams, UI mockups, or verbal requirements. | MCP               |
| **Global Knowledge**          | Implement **Distributed collaboration across networks** to securely link multiple ![](data:,) instances. This creates a global, evolving, shared knowledge graph.                               | MCP               |
| **External Integration**      | Prioritize the creation of a **Plugin Ecosystem**, and integrate with **External Knowledge Bases** to broaden the system's contextual awareness beyond WordNet.                                 | PocketFlow, MCP   |
| **Concept Versioning**        | Implement **Version control for concept evolution**, tracking how core semantic concepts and best practices change over time.                                                                   | Persistence Layer |
