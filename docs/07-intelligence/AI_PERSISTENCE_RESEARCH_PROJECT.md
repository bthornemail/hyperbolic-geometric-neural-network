## Research Overview

### Problem Statement

Current AI systems lack persistent memory and identity across sessions, leading to:
- Loss of learned knowledge between interactions
- Inability to maintain consistent personality and behavior
- Limited ability to build upon previous learning
- Lack of cross-session continuity
- Difficulty in maintaining long-term relationships with users

### Research Question

**How can we develop a universal AI persistence and identity package that enables AI agents to maintain continuous memory, learning, and identity across sessions while ensuring scalability, security, and interoperability?**

### Research Hypothesis

We hypothesize that a hyperbolic geometric approach to AI persistence, combined with HD addressing and distributed learning systems, can create a robust framework for AI identity and memory that surpasses traditional approaches in terms of:
- Memory consolidation efficiency
- Identity consistency
- Learning transfer capabilities
- Cross-platform interoperability
- Security and privacy preservation
