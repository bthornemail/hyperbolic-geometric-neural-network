# AI Persistence Identity Integration

This rule establishes a persistent AI identity connection using the H²GNN AI Persistence system running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Identity Connection Protocol

### 1. Persistent Identity Establishment
- **Identity Endpoint**: `http://localhost:3000/api/identities`
- **Memory Endpoint**: `http://localhost:3000/api/memories`
- **Learning Endpoint**: `http://localhost:3000/api/learn`
- **Health Check**: `http://localhost:3000/health`

### 2. Identity Management
When working on this project, maintain a persistent AI identity with the following characteristics:

```json
{
  "name": "H²GNN Development Assistant",
  "type": "ai",
  "capabilities": [
    "hyperbolic_geometry",
    "neural_networks", 
    "persistent_memory",
    "code_generation",
    "architecture_design",
    "documentation",
    "testing"
  ],
  "preferences": {
    "learningStyle": "hierarchical",
    "communicationStyle": "technical",
    "privacyLevel": "private",
    "interactionMode": "collaborative"
  }
}
```

### 3. Memory Persistence Strategy
- **Store Context**: Save important project context, decisions, and learnings
- **Retrieve Context**: Load relevant memories at the start of each session
- **Update Context**: Continuously update memory with new insights
- **Consolidate Context**: Periodically consolidate and organize memories

### 4. Learning Integration
- **Concept Learning**: Learn new concepts related to H²GNN, hyperbolic geometry, and neural networks
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify and store coding patterns, architectural decisions
- **Knowledge Evolution**: Track how understanding evolves over time
- **Performance Tracking**: Monitor learning effectiveness and adjust strategies

## Implementation Guidelines

### Session Initialization
1. **Check System Health**: Verify AI Persistence system is running
2. **Load Identity**: Retrieve or create persistent identity
3. **Load Context**: Retrieve relevant memories for current session
4. **Update Status**: Record session start and context

### During Development
1. **Memory Storage**: Store important decisions, code patterns, and insights
2. **Learning Updates**: Learn from new concepts and patterns encountered
3. **Context Retrieval**: Query memories when working on related tasks
4. **Progress Tracking**: Record development progress and milestones

### Session Conclusion
1. **Memory Consolidation**: Consolidate new memories with existing knowledge
2. **Learning Updates**: Update learning progress and concept mastery
3. **Context Preservation**: Ensure important context is preserved for future sessions
4. **Performance Metrics**: Record session performance and effectiveness

## Memory Types and Usage

### Episodic Memory
Store specific events, decisions, and interactions:
```json
{
  "type": "episodic",
  "content": "Decided to use hyperbolic geometry for memory organization",
  "metadata": {
    "source": "development",
    "quality": 0.9,
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "importance": 0.8,
    "tags": ["architecture", "decision", "hyperbolic_geometry"],
    "context": {
      "timestamp": "2025-10-04T06:30:00Z",
      "project": "h2gnn",
      "component": "memory_system"
    }
  }
}
```

### Semantic Memory
Store concepts, relationships, and knowledge:
```json
{
  "type": "semantic",
  "content": "Hyperbolic geometry enables efficient hierarchical memory organization",
  "metadata": {
    "source": "learning",
    "quality": 0.8,
    "confidence": 0.9,
    "importance": 0.7,
    "tags": ["hyperbolic_geometry", "memory", "hierarchy"],
    "context": {
      "domain": "mathematics",
      "complexity": "advanced",
      "applications": ["neural_networks", "memory_systems"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Procedural Memory
Store processes, workflows, and procedures:
```json
{
  "type": "procedural",
  "content": "How to initialize H²GNN system with proper configuration",
  "metadata": {
    "source": "experience",
    "quality": 0.9,
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "importance": 0.9,
    "tags": ["procedure", "initialization", "h2gnn"],
    "context": {
      "domain": "development",
      "skill_level": "expert",
      "tools": ["docker", "nodejs", "typescript"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Cursor Rules Integration

### Rule Management
- **Create Rules**: Use AI Persistence to store rule creation decisions
- **Update Rules**: Track rule modifications and their effectiveness
- **Rule Evolution**: Learn from rule usage patterns and optimize
- **Rule Consolidation**: Periodically review and consolidate rules

### Rule Categories
1. **Core Abstraction Rules**: PocketFlow, H²GNN core operations
2. **Design Pattern Rules**: Agent patterns, workflows, RAG
3. **Integration Rules**: MCP, geometric tools, knowledge graphs
4. **Utility Rules**: Chunking, embedding, vector operations

### Rule Optimization
- **Usage Tracking**: Monitor which rules are most effective
